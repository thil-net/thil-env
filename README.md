thil-env
=============

A set of files to load onto THIL so you can figure out the runtime environment.

To load it (or any GitHub repo) into THIL (http://www.thil.net/), find the â€œdownload ZIP" button on the lower right of the repository page, copy the URL that it links to, and feed it to THIL as a quoted string. Like this:

http://api.thil.net/put/?"https://github.com/thil-net/thil-env/archive/master.zip"

Your THIL URL will always run the latest version. If you want to load it once and ignore updates, just don't quote the ZIP url when you give it to THIL.
